## Welcome
Hello, I'm Aidan Himley and you've reached my personal Github account. Here are a few of the projects I've done.

## Robotic Foosball Table

For my Computer Engineering capstone project, I worked in a team with 4 of my peers to design and create a robotic foosball table capable of playing against a human opponent. I was responsible for programming the image processing for ball detection, the player path planning, and some of the embedded motor control code. The source code for the project lives at https://github.com/zacharyyahn/capstone, and you can view a video of the table in action [here](https://github.com/AidanHimley/portfolio/blob/main/media/20221211_220811.mp4?raw=true).

## Fermilab Software Internship
During my Summer 2022 internship at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (Fermilab), I worked to containerize elements of Fermilab's [Glidein Workflow Management System](https://glideinwms.fnal.gov/doc.prd/index.html) and [HEPCloud Decision Engine](https://hepcloud.github.io/decisionengine/) using Docker, Kubernetes, and Helm. The source code for my work can be found at https://github.com/AidanHimley/containers/tree/dev and https://github.com/AidanHimley/decisionengine/tree/master/package/container/framework. Below is shown a summary poster I made at the conclusion of my internship to explain my work to an audience not intimately familiar with the technology involved.

## Interactive Website
In my Advanced Software Development course, I worked in a team of 5 to create an interactive website for posting recipes. The website was written using Django and features user authentication and Ajax requests. The source code can be found at https://github.com/AidanHimley/group-project-a-05, but unfortunately the website is not currently hosted anywhere, as it was formerly hosted on Heroku free dynos, which no longer exist.

## Gaming-Related Projects
I have done a few gaming-related side projects, which I keep at another Github account, https://github.com/6point28etc/, to maintain an online presence separate from my personal information.

### Celeste Speedrun Tool Contribution
The Celeste Speedrun Tool is an open-source speedrun practice tool modification for the video game Celeste. I made a fork to add a feature to the in-game timer that I wanted for my own use, and my improvement was pulled into the main repository. My fork can be found at https://github.com/6point28etc/CelesteSpeedrunTool.

### GL Web Service
I made a simple, tounge-in-cheek web service to fetch information from a random Wikipedia article that can be abbreviated to "GL" (the rationale being that "gl" is a common abbreviation for "good luck" in the speedrunning community). The source code can be found at https://github.com/6point28etc/gl, and the service is hosted at https://gl-q9zr.onrender.com/ (it's on a scale-to-zero deployment so it will likely take a while to respond the first time if you visit).
